# HandDetector
This repository contains the project I worked on during my internship at Simtek

##About This Project
This project has hand detection, hand tracking, finger tracking, finger counting and drawing functionalities. It's written in C++ and uses OpenCv library. 
At startup, the program asks the user to place their hand in the middle of the camera and press the 'Enter' key to read the hand color. After this step it automatically switches to the finger counting mode. There is also a drawing mode that the user can switch to using the 'S' key. The user can exit the program using the 'Esc' key.
